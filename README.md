coarseDataTools
===============

This is the repository for the coarseDataTools R package. We use this as a development space. The most recent, stable version of the package can be downloaded either from CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/coarseDataTools/) or from the most recent release version on github (https://github.com/nickreich/coarseDataTools/releases).

This package contains functions to analyze coarsely observed data.
    Specifically, it contains functions to (1) fit parametric accelerated
    failure time models to interval-censored survival time data, and (2)
    estimate the case-fatality ratio in scenarios with underreporting.
    This package's development was motivated by applications to infectious
    disease: in particular, problems with estimating the incubation period and
    the case fatality ratio of a given disease. Sample data files are included
    in the package.
